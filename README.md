This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ rocketeer plugin:install rocketeers/rocketeer-laravel
```

## Usage

The plugin adds the Artisan binary accessible from any task or strategy:

```php
$this->artisan()->runForCurrentRelease('cache:clear');
```

It also adds two strategies:

- Check:Laravel: extends the PHP check strategy but adds a few checks related to your application
- Migrate:Artisan: uses Artisan to migrate your database

## Testing

``` bash
$ phpunit
```
